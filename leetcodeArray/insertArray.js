In fact, the time taken for insertion at the beginning of an Array will be proportional to the length of the Array. In terms of time complexity analysis, this is a linear time complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the Array. */

If you think about it, insertion at the beginning is basically a special case of inserting an element at a given indexâ€”in that case, the given index was 0. */
